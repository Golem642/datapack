This is a datapack made for the AvdanOS Minecraft server, all credits goes to the amazing DqwertyC : https://www.youtube.com/user/DqwertyC

What it does :

1) Quick portals
- Place a lodestone and use a compass on it
- Place a respawn anchor somewhere else and drop the linked compass and an enderpearl on top of it
- The respawn anchor should become a portal and you can get through to teleport to the lodestone
- (you can destroy the lodestone if you want, the portal will still work

More functions coming soon...
